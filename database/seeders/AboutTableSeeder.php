            As of 2016, Kenyan population growth was estimated at 4.2% per
            annum. Based on this growth and rate of urban migration, the
            yearly annual increase in demand for housing in Kenya is
            estimated at 206,000 units annually of which 82,000 are in urban
            areas. According to data from The Kenya Ministry of Housing, it is
            estimated that the formal supply of houses to the market falls
            short by 156,000.
            The frst implication of this shortfall has been rise of slums in
            urban are the as. According to Kenyan 2009 population census,
            over 30% of the countryâ€™s population lives in slums. In Nairobi
